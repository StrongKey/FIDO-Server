# Contributing to StrongKey's FIDO2 Server

We welcome contributions to this open-source FIDO2 Server! This guide provides some tips for successful contributions.

For complex changes, we recommend filing a GitHub Issue to start a discussion with project maintainers before implementing the change.

## Pull Requests

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a Pull Request:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add test code to the RXPTest sample app.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the .yaml documentation files.
4. Ensure your test suite passes.
5. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"), linked below.
6. Submit your Pull Request through GitHub.

## Issues and New Features

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature additions.

### Did you discover a bug?

Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in FIDO CES, and instead to refer to our security policy.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

If possible, use git [Issues](https://github.com/StrongKey/FIDO-Server/issues) to create the issue. Click the NEW ISSUE, then BUG REPORT, then complete the form. 

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug (including documentation)?

Open a new GitHub Pull Request with the patch.

Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one (including documentation)? 

Submit a Feature Request with your change using git [Issues](https://github.com/StrongKey/FIDO-Server/issues) to create the issue. Click the NEW ISSUE, then FEATURE REQUEST, completing the form; then start writing code.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
