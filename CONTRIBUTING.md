## Issues and New Features

We use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/StrongKey/FIDO-Server/issues) to track bugs and feature additions.

### Did you discover a bug?

Do not open up a GitHub Issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in FIDO CES, and instead to refer to our security policy.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Please use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/StrongKey/FIDO-Server/issues) to create the Bug Report. Click NEW ISSUE, then GET STARTED in the row labeled BUG REPORT, then complete the form. 

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug (including documentation)?

Open a new GitHub Pull Request with the patch.

Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one (including documentation)? 

Submit a Feature Request with your change using GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/StrongKey/FIDO-Server/issues). Click NEW ISSUE, then GET STARTED in the row labeled FEATURE REQUEST, completing the form; then start writing code.

Do not open a Feature Request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for Bug Reports and fixes.
